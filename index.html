                Gokuu Son is a young boy who lives in the woods all alone—that is, until a girl named Bulma runs into
                him in her search for a set of magical objects called the "Dragon Balls." Since the artifacts are said
                to grant one wish to whoever collects all seven, Bulma hopes to gather them and wish for a perfect
                boyfriend. Gokuu happens to be in possession of a dragon ball, but unfortunately for Bulma, he refuses
                to part ways with it, so she makes him a deal: he can tag along on her journey if he lets her borrow the
                dragon ball's power. With that, the two set off on the journey of a lifetime.
                <br><br>
                They don't go on the journey alone. On the way, they meet the old Muten-Roshi and wannabe disciple
                Kuririn, with whom Gokuu trains to become a stronger martial artist for the upcoming World Martial Arts
                Tournament. However, it's not all fun and games; the ability to make any wish come true is a powerful
                one, and there are others who would do much worse than just wishing for a boyfriend. To stop those who
                would try to abuse the legendary power, they train to become stronger fighters, using their newfound
                strength to help the people around them along the way.

                Death Note
            </h2>

            <p>
                A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they see their victim's face and write
                their victim's name
                in a notebook called a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the shinigami lifestyle and interested in
                seeing how a human
                would use a Death Note, drops one into the human realm.
                <br><br>
                High school student and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the Death Note and—since he deplores the
                state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by writing a criminal's name in it. When the criminal dies
                immediately following his experiment with the Death Note, Light is greatly surprised and quickly
                recognizes how devastating the power that has fallen into his hands could be.
                <br><br>
                With this divine capability, Light decides to extinguish all criminals in order to build a new world
                where crime does not exist and people worship him as a god. Police, however, quickly discover that a
                serial killer is targeting criminals and, consequently, try to apprehend the culprit. To do this, the
                Japanese investigators count on the assistance of the best detective in the world: a young and eccentric
                man known only by the name of L.

                Ever since the death of his father, the burden of supporting the family has fallen upon Tanjirou
                Kamado's shoulders. Though living impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to enjoy
                a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local village to make
                a little money selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou to take shelter in the
                house of a strange man, who warns him of the existence of flesh-eating demons that lurk in the woods at
                night.
                <br><br>
                When he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a horrifying sight—his whole family has
                been slaughtered. Worse still, the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a
                bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, Tanjirou swears to avenge his family and stay by his
                only remaining sibling. Alongside the mysterious group calling themselves the Demon Slayer Corps,
                Tanjirou will do whatever it takes to slay the demons and protect the remnants of his beloved sister's
                humanity.

                Hunter x Hunter is set in a world where Hunters exist to perform all manner of dangerous tasks like
                capturing criminals and bravely searching for lost treasures in uncharted territories. Twelve-year-old
                Gon Freecss is determined to become the best Hunter possible in hopes of finding his father, who was a
                Hunter himself and had long ago abandoned his young son. However, Gon soon realizes the path to
                achieving his goals is far more challenging than he could have ever imagined.
                <br><br>
                Along the way to becoming an official Hunter, Gon befriends the lively doctor-in-training Leorio,
                vengeful Kurapika, and rebellious ex-assassin Killua. To attain their own goals and desires, together
                the four of them take the Hunter Exam, notorious for its low success rate and high probability of death.
                Throughout their journey, Gon and his friends embark on an adventure that puts them through many
                hardships and struggles. They will meet a plethora of monsters, creatures, and characters—all while
                learning what being a Hunter truly means.

                Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club, high schooler Yuuji Itadori
                spends his days at either the clubroom or the hospital, where he visits his bedridden grandfather.
                However, this leisurely lifestyle soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a
                cursed item. Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly thrust into
                the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice and negativity—after swallowing the said
                item, revealed to be a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the "King of Curses."

                Yuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses pose to society as he discovers his own newfound
                powers. Introduced to the Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, he begins to walk down a
                path from which he cannot return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer.
